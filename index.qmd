## Global food price inflation varies globally. the following data was pulled from kaggle. The inflation column was plotted against the date column using multiple lines to represent different countries in order to make an intuitive graph. looking at the inflation rates, we can see that global inflation on food prices has spiked in the last 5 years.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

dataset_path <- "WLD_RTFP_country_2023-10-02 (2).csv"
food_prices <- read_csv(dataset_path)


# Display the structure of the dataset

food_prices_inflation <- food_prices %>%
  select(date, Inflation, country) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Inflation))  # Remove rows with NA values in Inflation


# Plotting global inflation on food prices
ggplot(food_prices_inflation, aes(x = date, y = Inflation, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth= 0.6) +  # Increase line thickness
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", date_labels = "%Y") +  # Adjust x-axis date breaks and labels
  labs(title = "Global Inflation on Food Prices",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Inflation on Food Prices (%)",
       color = "Country") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")  # Adjust legend position if needed
```

this shows how food prices have increased over the last decade or so
